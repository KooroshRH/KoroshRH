## About me
I am a Computer engineering student with a background in software development with over two years of experience in the game industry. I helped the best-selling Iranian game in the previous position by changing the whole game development platform from the corona game engine to the Unity game engine. I am also researching deep learning topics, computer vision, and generative models.
